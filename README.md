# Fetching User Cards with Vue.js


On this small project, the intention was to fetch data in JSON format from an API present online and display it.

There's also a heading changing colour based on the background colour of 3 squared shapes.

Main points of interest:
-   Using async / await and fetch to pull the JSON data from the API;
-   Treating the JSON data to display it;
-   Four vue.js components, where one acts as a grid for the other three;
-   Emitting an event on a mouse-over and grabbing it to change the colour of a heading based on the background colour of the element being targetted.
